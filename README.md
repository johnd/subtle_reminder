Subtle Reminder App
===================

This is a fairly ugly Electron menu bar app intended to give you a subtle
(unintrusive chime + icon turning red) reminder every so often.

I'm going to use it to remind myself to stand up and move around a bit so that
doing computers doesn't literally kill me.

Disclaimer: I am not an expert in JavaScript development at all. Many parts of
this app are likely to not only not be best practices, but in fact bad
practices, and possibly even *the worst* practices.
